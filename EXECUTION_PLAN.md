# Robotics Glossary Execution Plan
## "The Ralph Wiggum Way" - One Thing at a Time

**Goal**: Build thought leadership in NVIDIA + ROS2 robotics. Zero to Hero journey.
**Philosophy**: Not a docs clone. Helpful summaries. Amazing content > more content.
**Validation Date**: January 20, 2026

## Phase 0: Audit & Fix Existing Content (Do This First)

### Files to Validate (19 content files)

Each file needs:
- [ ] Content accuracy check against official Jan 2026 sources
- [ ] Version numbers updated (JetPack, Isaac ROS, ROS 2 distros)
- [ ] Broken link check
- [ ] Add `last_validated: 2026-01-20` to frontmatter
- [ ] Add Sources section with proper citations

#### Priority 1: NVIDIA Stack (Our Differentiator)
| File | Status | Key Validation Points |
|------|--------|----------------------|
| `hardware/compute/jetson-orin.mdx` | ✅ | JetPack 6.x LTS status, verify Thor migration guide exists |
| `hardware/compute/jetson-thor.mdx` | 🔴 | Verify specs (Thor was announced but check GA status) |
| `hardware/compute/dgx-spark.mdx` | 🔴 | Announced GTC 2025, verify availability/specs |
| `software/isaac/isaac-ros.mdx` | 🔴 | Isaac ROS 3.2 → check if 4.0 is out, NITROS changes |
| `software/simulation/isaac-sim.mdx` | 🔴 | Isaac Sim 4.x status, Omniverse integration |

#### Priority 2: ROS2 Ecosystem
| File | Status | Key Validation Points |
|------|--------|----------------------|
| `software/frameworks/ros2.mdx` | 🔴 | Humble EOL date, Jazzy status, Rolling changes |

#### Priority 3: Sensors & Fundamentals
| File | Status | Key Validation Points |
|------|--------|----------------------|
| `hardware/sensors/lidar.mdx` | 🔴 | Current sensor landscape |
| `hardware/sensors/cameras.mdx` | 🔴 | Depth camera options, NVIDIA support |
| `hardware/sensors/imu.mdx` | 🔴 | Standard reference |
| `concepts/fundamentals/kinematics.mdx` | 🔴 | Timeless, light review |
| `concepts/fundamentals/degrees-of-freedom.mdx` | 🔴 | Timeless, light review |
| `concepts/perception/slam.mdx` | 🔴 | Isaac ROS SLAM packages |
| `concepts/control/motion-planning.mdx` | 🔴 | cuMotion integration |
| `concepts/control/pid.mdx` | 🔴 | Timeless, light review |
| `concepts/ai/neural-networks.mdx` | 🔴 | General, light review |
| `concepts/ai/reinforcement-learning.mdx` | 🔴 | Robotics RL landscape |

## Phase 1: Content Enhancement (After Audit)

### Citation Standard

Every entry should have a **Sources** section at the bottom:

```markdown
## Sources

- [Official Name](url) — What we referenced from here
- [Paper/Article Title](url) — Specific claim this supports
```

**Rules**:
1. NVIDIA docs → cite directly with version
2. ROS docs → cite with distro
3. Academic concepts → cite authoritative textbook or paper
4. Performance claims → must have source or mark as "typical" / "approximate"

### Content Quality Checklist

For each entry, verify:

- [ ] **One clear definition** in first paragraph (no jargon soup)
- [ ] **Why it matters** for robotics (not just what it is)
- [ ] **Practical example** or code that actually works
- [ ] **Honest trade-offs** (not marketing copy)
- [ ] **Connected to the journey** (prerequisites + next steps)
- [ ] **Sources cited** for any factual claims

## Phase 2: Missing Critical Content (Zero to Hero Path)

### The Learning Journey

```
[Beginner] → [Foundation] → [Integration] → [Production]
```

### New Entries Needed (Prioritized)

#### Must Have (Core Journey)
| Entry | Why Essential | Priority |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| `concepts/fundamentals/transforms.mdx` | Foundation for all robotics math | P0 |
| `concepts/fundamentals/coordinate-frames.mdx` | Can't understand TF without this | P0 |
| `software/ros2/tf2.mdx` | Core ROS2 concept, links to fundamentals | P0 |
| `software/ros2/nav2.mdx` | Navigation is core use case | P0 |
| `software/ros2/moveit2.mdx` | Manipulation is core use case | P0 |
| `software/nvidia/cumotion.mdx` | NVIDIA's MoveIt alternative | P1 |
| `software/nvidia/nvblox.mdx` | 3D reconstruction, core for nav | P1 |
| `software/ros2/urdf-xacro.mdx` | Robot description, foundation | P1 |

#### Should Have (Complete the Story)
| Entry | Why Important | Priority |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| `concepts/perception/visual-odometry.mdx` | Bridges SLAM and cameras | P2 |
| `concepts/perception/sensor-fusion.mdx` | Real robots need this | P2 |
| `software/nvidia/isaac-lab.mdx` | Sim-to-real training | P2 |
| `software/nvidia/tensorrt.mdx` | Inference optimization | P2 |
| `hardware/sensors/depth-cameras.mdx` | Specific to stereo/ToF | P2 |

## Phase 3: Zero to Hero Learning Paths

### Path 1: "I Have a Jetson, Now What?"
```
jetson-orin → jetpack-setup → ros2-install → isaac-ros → first-robot
```

### Path 2: "ROS2 Developer → NVIDIA Acceleration"
```
ros2 → nav2 → isaac-ros → nitros → performance-tuning
```

### Path 3: "Robotics Beginner → First AMR"
```
degrees-of-freedom → coordinate-frames → transforms → tf2 → urdf → nav2
```

**Implementation**: Add `learning_paths` frontmatter and create `/paths/` pages later.

## Quality Gates

Before any content goes live:

1. **Accuracy**: Claims verified against official source dated 2025+
2. **Freshness**: No outdated version numbers or deprecated APIs
3. **Citations**: Sources section present with working links
4. **Clarity**: Definition understandable without prior knowledge
5. **Utility**: Reader can take action after reading
6. **Connection**: Links to prerequisites and next steps

## What We Are NOT Doing

- ❌ Copying NVIDIA docs verbatim
- ❌ Writing 5000-word essays when 500 words suffice
- ❌ Covering every NVIDIA product (focus: robotics)
- ❌ Generic AI/ML content (focus: robotics applications)
- ❌ Historical deep-dives (focus: what works today)

## Success Looks Like

- Engineer finds us searching "isaac ros tutorial"
- Reads 3 entries, understands how pieces connect
- Bookmarks for reference
- Shares with team
- Eventually contributes back

### Reset Progress
```bash
rm .ralph-progress
```

### Files Created
```
