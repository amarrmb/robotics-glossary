## Content Levels

Each entry is tagged with a level indicating the type of content:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 1rem; flex-wrap: wrap; margin: 1rem 0;">
  <span class="level-badge conceptual">Conceptual</span>
  <span class="level-badge practical">Practical</span>
  <span class="level-badge deepdive">Deep Dive</span>
</div>

### Conceptual
Theory and foundational understanding. Answers "what is this?" and "why does it matter?"

**Examples:** Kinematics, Degrees of Freedom, Coordinate Frames

### Practical
Hands-on, how-to content. Answers "how do I use this?" with code, setup guides, and workflows.

**Examples:** Jetson Thor, ROS 2, Isaac ROS, DGX Spark

### Deep Dive
Comprehensive, in-depth coverage. Goes beyond basics into architecture, algorithms, and advanced usage.

**Examples:** SLAM (full pipeline breakdown), Motion Planning algorithms

## Site Organization

The glossary is organized by **domain**:

### Concepts
Theoretical foundations that underpin robotics:
- **Fundamentals** — Core concepts (kinematics, DOF, transforms)
- **Perception** — How robots sense the world (SLAM, vision, sensor fusion)
- **Control & Planning** — How robots decide and act
- **AI & Learning** — Machine learning for robotics

### Hardware
Physical compute platforms and components:
- **Compute Platforms** — Jetson Thor, Jetson Orin, DGX Spark
- **Sensors** — Cameras, LiDAR, IMU
- **Actuators** — Motors, servos, grippers

### Software
Tools, frameworks, and platforms:
- **Frameworks** — ROS 2 and middleware
- **Isaac Platform** — NVIDIA's robotics software stack
- **Simulation** — Isaac Sim, Gazebo
- **SDKs & Tools** — TensorRT, cuDNN, etc.
