**Reinforcement Learning (RL)** is a machine learning paradigm where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards. Unlike supervised learning, the agent isn't told the correct action — it discovers good behavior through trial and error.

## The RL Framework

```
         ┌───────────────────────────────┐
         │         Environment           │
         │   (Robot + World Simulation)  │
         └──────────┬──────────┬─────────┘
                    │          │
              State │          │ Reward
                    ▼          ▼
         ┌───────────────────────────────┐
         │            Agent              │
         │    (Neural Network Policy)    │
         └──────────────┬────────────────┘
                        │
                   Action
                        ▼
                   Environment
```

**Key components:**
- **State (s)**: What the agent observes (sensor readings, joint positions)
- **Action (a)**: What the agent can do (motor commands, gripper open/close)
- **Reward (r)**: Scalar feedback signal (positive = good, negative = bad)
- **Policy (π)**: Mapping from states to actions (what we're learning)

## Why RL for Robotics?

RL shines when:
- **Optimal behavior is unknown** — Can't manually program dexterous manipulation
- **Environment is complex** — Physics interactions are hard to model exactly
- **Adaptation is needed** — Robot should improve with experience

Classic successes:
- Quadruped locomotion (ANYmal, Spot)
- Dexterous manipulation (OpenAI Rubik's cube)
- Drone racing (beating human champions)

## Core Algorithms

### Value-Based Methods

Learn the **value** of being in a state (or taking an action).

**Q-Learning / DQN**:
```
Q(s, a) = expected total reward from taking action a in state s
```

Pick action with highest Q-value:
```python
action = argmax(Q(state, all_actions))
```

**Limitations**: Only works with discrete actions.

### Policy Gradient Methods

Directly learn the **policy** — a probability distribution over actions.

**REINFORCE**:
```
∇J(θ) = E[∇log π(a|s) · R]
```

Increase probability of actions that led to high rewards.

**Actor-Critic**:
- **Actor**: Policy network (what action to take)
- **Critic**: Value network (how good is this state)

### Popular Algorithms

| Algorithm | Type | Best For |
|-----------|------|----------|
| PPO | Policy gradient | General purpose, stable |
| SAC | Actor-critic | Sample efficient, continuous control |
| TD3 | Actor-critic | Continuous control, less hyperparameter sensitive |
| DrQ-v2 | Image-based | Learning from pixels |

## Sim-to-Real Transfer

Training RL in the real world is slow and dangerous. Solution: **train in simulation, deploy on real robot**.

### The Sim-to-Real Gap

Simulations don't perfectly match reality:
- Physics approximations
- Sensor noise differences
- Actuator dynamics

### Domain Randomization

Randomize simulation parameters so policy becomes robust:

```python
# Randomize during training
friction = uniform(0.5, 1.5)
mass = uniform(0.8, 1.2) * nominal_mass
observation_noise = normal(0, 0.01)
```

The policy learns to handle variation, transfers better to real world.

### NVIDIA Isaac Sim 5.1 + Isaac Lab 2.3

```bash
# Train locomotion policy with RSL-RL
python source/standalone/workflows/rsl_rl/train.py \
    --task Isaac-Velocity-Flat-Anymal-D-v0 \
    --num_envs 4096
```

Or use the Python API:

```python
from omni.isaac.lab.envs import ManagerBasedRLEnv

env = ManagerBasedRLEnv(
    cfg=robot_cfg,
    num_envs=4096,  # Massive parallelism on GPU
)
```

**Benefits**:
- 4096+ environments in parallel on single GPU (~90,000 FPS training)
- Photorealistic rendering for vision-based RL
- Domain randomization built-in with ADR (Automatic Domain Randomization)
- PBT (Population-Based Training) support

## Reward Engineering

The reward function shapes what the robot learns. This is **critical** and often the hardest part.

### Sparse vs Dense Rewards

**Sparse**: Reward only at goal (task complete = +1, else 0)
- Hard to learn — random exploration rarely finds goal
- Clear signal — no reward hacking

**Dense**: Continuous feedback (distance to goal, velocity toward target)
- Easier to learn — gradient toward goal
- Risk of reward hacking — robot finds unintended shortcuts

### Reward Shaping Example

```python
def compute_reward(state, action, next_state):
    # Goal: reach target position
    distance = np.linalg.norm(next_state.position - target)

    # Dense reward: closer is better
    reward = -distance

    # Bonus for reaching goal
    if distance < 0.05:
        reward += 100

    # Penalty for excessive force
    reward -= 0.01 * np.sum(action**2)

    return reward
```

## Practical Tips

### What Works
- **PPO** — Most reliable starting point
- **Simulation** — Always start in sim, even for simple tasks
- **Curriculum** — Start easy, increase difficulty
- **Reward normalization** — Keep rewards in reasonable range

### Common Pitfalls
- **Reward hacking** — Robot finds unintended way to maximize reward
- **Hyperparameter sensitivity** — RL algorithms are notoriously finicky
- **Sample inefficiency** — May need millions of steps
- **Sim-to-real gap** — Works in sim, fails on real robot
