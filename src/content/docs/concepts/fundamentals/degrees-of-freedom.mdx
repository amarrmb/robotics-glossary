**Degrees of Freedom (DOF)** refers to the number of independent variables needed to completely specify the position and orientation of a system. In robotics, DOF determines what movements a robot can make.

## Rigid Body in Space

A rigid body floating freely in 3D space has **6 DOF**:

| DOF | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| 3 | Translation | Movement along X, Y, Z axes |
| 3 | Rotation | Rotation about X (roll), Y (pitch), Z (yaw) |

This is why robot end-effectors often need 6+ joints to reach any position and orientation.

## Common Robot Configurations

| Robot Type | Typical DOF | Notes |
|------------|-------------|-------|
| 2D mobile base | 3 | x, y, θ (heading) |
| Quadcopter | 6 | Full 3D position + orientation |
| Industrial arm | 6 | Minimum for arbitrary pose |
| Collaborative arm | 7 | Redundant (extra flexibility) |
| Humanoid arm | 7+ | Mimics human arm |
| Human hand | 27 | Extremely dexterous |

## Redundancy

A robot is **kinematically redundant** when it has more DOF than needed for a task:

- **6-DOF arm** reaching a 3D point (needs only 3 DOF) → Redundant
- **7-DOF arm** reaching a 6D pose → 1 DOF redundancy

Redundancy enables:
- Obstacle avoidance while maintaining end-effector pose
- Optimizing for secondary objectives (minimize energy, avoid singularities)
- More natural, human-like motion

## Constraints Reduce DOF

Real robots have constraints that reduce effective DOF:

- **Joint limits**: Can't rotate beyond certain angles
- **Obstacles**: Some configurations cause collisions
- **Singularities**: Configurations where DOF is temporarily lost

## Calculating DOF

For a mechanism with joints:

```
DOF = Σ(joint freedoms) - constraints
```

**Grübler's Formula** (planar mechanisms):
```
DOF = 3(n-1) - 2j₁ - j₂
```
Where:
- n = number of links (including ground)
- j₁ = number of 1-DOF joints
- j₂ = number of 2-DOF joints

For spatial (3D) mechanisms, replace the coefficient 3 with 6.

## Workspace vs Configuration Space

- **Workspace**: The set of positions/orientations the end-effector can reach (in Cartesian space)
- **Configuration Space (C-space)**: The set of all possible joint configurations (dimension = DOF)

A 6-DOF robot arm has a 6-dimensional configuration space, even though it operates in 3D workspace.
