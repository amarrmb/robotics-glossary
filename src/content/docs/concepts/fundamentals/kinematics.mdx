**Kinematics** is the branch of robotics that describes *how parts of a robot move in space* (the geometry of motion), *without considering the forces* (such as torque or inertia) that cause the motion. It provides the mathematical foundation for computing where an end-effector will be given joint angles (forward kinematics) and for determining what joint angles are needed to reach a desired pose (inverse kinematics).

<Aside type="tip">
Think of kinematics as the "geometry of motion" — it answers *where* things move, not *why* they move.

## Forward vs Inverse Kinematics

### Forward Kinematics (FK)

Given the joint angles/positions, compute where the end-effector is in space.

```
Joint Angles → [FK] → End-Effector Position
θ₁, θ₂, θ₃  →      → (x, y, z, roll, pitch, yaw)
```

**Example**: If a 2-link arm has joints at 45° and 30°, where is the gripper?

### Inverse Kinematics (IK)

Given a desired end-effector position, compute the required joint angles.

```
End-Effector Position → [IK] → Joint Angles
(x, y, z, orientation) →      → θ₁, θ₂, θ₃, ...
```

**Example**: To reach a cup at position (0.5, 0.3, 0.2), what should the joint angles be?

<Aside type="caution">
IK is generally harder than FK. There may be **multiple solutions** (or none) for a given target position.
</Aside>

## The Kinematic Chain

Robots are modeled as a series of **links** (rigid bodies) connected by **joints**:

```
Base → Joint₁ → Link₁ → Joint₂ → Link₂ → ... → End-Effector
```

Each joint adds degrees of freedom:
- **Revolute joint**: 1 DOF (rotation)
- **Prismatic joint**: 1 DOF (linear sliding)
- **Spherical joint**: 3 DOF (ball-and-socket)

## Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) Parameters

The standard way to describe robot kinematics uses four parameters per joint:

| Parameter | Symbol | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Link length | aᵢ | Distance along xᵢ |
| Link twist | αᵢ | Angle about xᵢ |
| Link offset | dᵢ | Distance along zᵢ₋₁ |
| Joint angle | θᵢ | Angle about zᵢ₋₁ |

<Aside>
DH parameters let you build transformation matrices that chain together to compute forward kinematics.

## Code Example

Using Python with NumPy for a simple 2-link planar arm:

```python
import numpy as np

def forward_kinematics_2link(theta1, theta2, L1, L2):
    """
    Compute end-effector position for a 2-link planar arm.

    Args:
        theta1: First joint angle (radians)
        theta2: Second joint angle (radians)
        L1: Length of first link
        L2: Length of second link

    Returns:
        (x, y) position of end-effector
    """
    # Position of joint 2
    x1 = L1 * np.cos(theta1)
    y1 = L1 * np.sin(theta1)

    # Position of end-effector
    x2 = x1 + L2 * np.cos(theta1 + theta2)
    y2 = y1 + L2 * np.sin(theta1 + theta2)

    return x2, y2

# Example: 45° and 30° with unit links
x, y = forward_kinematics_2link(
    np.radians(45),
    np.radians(30),
    L1=1.0,
    L2=1.0
)
print(f"End-effector at: ({x:.3f}, {y:.3f})")
# Output: End-effector at: (0.259, 1.966)
```
