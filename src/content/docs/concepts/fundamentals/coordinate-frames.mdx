**Coordinate frames** (or reference frames) are the foundation for how robots understand position in space. A frame consists of an origin point and three orthogonal axes (x, y, z) that define directions of measurement. Every position, velocity, or orientation in robotics is defined *relative to some frame*.

<Aside type="tip">
Always ask: "What frame is this measurement in?" — a position only makes sense when you know the reference frame.
</Aside>

## What Is a Coordinate Frame?

A coordinate frame defines:
- An **origin** — the (0, 0, 0) point where measurements start
- Three **orthogonal axes** — x, y, z directions
- A **handedness** — typically right-handed in robotics

```
         z (up)
         │
         │
         │
         ●───────► y (left)
        /origin
       /
      ↙
     x (forward)

  Right-Hand Rule (ROS Convention)
```

Frames can be **fixed** (attached to the world) or **moving** (attached to a robot or sensor).

## Why Frames Matter

- **Sensors report locally**: A camera sees objects in *its* frame — you must transform to the robot frame to act
- **Multiple perspectives**: "1 meter to the left" depends on *whose* left
- **Kinematic chains**: Robot arms have frames for each link: base → link1 → link2 → gripper
- **Sensor fusion**: Without consistent frames, you can't combine data from multiple sensors

## Standard Frames in Robotics

```
map                    ← World-fixed (SLAM corrected)
 └── odom              ← Robot starting point (drifts over time)
      └── base_link    ← Robot body center
           ├── camera_link
           │    └── camera_optical_frame
           ├── lidar_link
           └── arm_base
                └── ... → gripper_link
```

| Frame | Description | ROS Name |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| World/Map | Fixed global reference, does not move | `map` |
| Odometry | Tracks motion from start, continuous but drifts | `odom` |
| Robot Base | Attached to robot body, moves with robot | `base_link` |
| Sensor | Local to each sensor (camera, LiDAR, IMU) | `*_link` |
| End-Effector | At gripper or tool tip | `gripper_link` |

<Aside type="caution">
Camera optical frames use z-forward, y-down — different from robot conventions. Always check sensor frame orientations.
</Aside>

## Frame Conventions

Different systems use different axis conventions:

```
Convention    X-axis     Y-axis     Z-axis     Used By
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
FLU (ROS)     Forward    Left       Up         ROS, ground robots
FRD           Forward    Right      Down       PX4, aircraft
NED           North      East       Down       Aviation, GPS
ENU           East       North      Up         Geographic systems
Camera        Right      Down       Forward    Computer vision
USD/Graphics  Right      Up         -Forward   NVIDIA Isaac, Blender
```

<Aside>
ROS follows **REP-103** (units/conventions) and **REP-105** (mobile robot frames). When integrating with Isaac Sim or other systems, you may need coordinate conversions.

## TF2: The Frame Tree

ROS 2 uses TF2 to manage frames as a **directed tree**:
- Each frame has exactly one parent (except the root)
- No cycles — unambiguous path between any two frames
- Time-buffered — query where a frame *was* at a past time

### Static vs Dynamic

- **Static transforms** (`/tf_static`): Fixed relationships like sensor mounts
- **Dynamic transforms** (`/tf`): Changing relationships like odometry or joint positions

## Working with Frames

### Visualize the Frame Tree

```bash
# Generate PDF of current transform tree
ros2 run tf2_tools view_frames

# Print transform between two frames
ros2 run tf2_ros tf2_echo map base_link
```

### Publish a Static Frame

```bash
ros2 run tf2_ros static_transform_publisher \
    --x 0.1 --y 0.0 --z 0.2 \
    --roll 0.0 --pitch 0.0 --yaw 0.0 \
    --frame-id base_link \
    --child-frame-id camera_link
```

### Query Frames in Python

```python
import rclpy
from rclpy.time import Time
from tf2_ros import Buffer, TransformListener

rclpy.init()
node = rclpy.create_node('frame_query')
tf_buffer = Buffer()
tf_listener = TransformListener(tf_buffer, node)

# Spin briefly to receive transforms
rclpy.spin_once(node, timeout_sec=1.0)

# Check if transform exists
can_transform = tf_buffer.can_transform('map', 'base_link', Time())
print(f"Can transform map→base_link: {can_transform}")

# List all known frames
print(tf_buffer.all_frames_as_yaml())
```

## Common Mistakes

1. **Wrong frame assumption**: Data is in a different frame than expected
2. **Forgetting camera conventions**: Optical frames are oriented differently
3. **Ignoring time**: Transforms change — use the correct timestamp
4. **Mixing conventions**: ROS uses meters/radians, other systems may differ
