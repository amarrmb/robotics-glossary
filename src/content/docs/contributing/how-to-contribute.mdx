description: Help grow the robotics glossary — add terms, fix errors, improve explanations
---

We welcome contributions from the robotics community! This glossary is open-source under CC-BY-4.0.

## Ways to Contribute

### 1. Add a New Term

The most valuable contribution! We need coverage across all categories.

**Process:**
1. Check if the term already exists (use search)
2. [Open an issue](https://github.com/amarrmb/robotics-glossary/issues/new?template=new-term.yml) proposing the term
3. Fork the repo and create a branch
4. Add your term following the [style guide](/robotics-glossary/contributing/style-guide/)
5. Submit a pull request

**High-priority terms we need:**
- Software: Omniverse, TensorRT, cuMotion, nvblox, MoveIt 2
- Hardware: More sensors, actuators, compute modules
- Concepts: Coordinate frames, sensor fusion, state estimation

### 2. Improve Existing Terms

- Fix errors or outdated information
- Add missing code examples
- Improve explanations for clarity
- Add diagrams or visualizations
- Update version numbers

### 3. Add Diagrams and Visuals

We strongly prefer visual explanations. You can contribute:
- Architecture diagrams (SVG or ASCII art)
- Flowcharts
- Comparison tables
- Code examples with output

### 4. Report Issues

Found an error? [Open an issue](https://github.com/amarrmb/robotics-glossary/issues/new?template=correction.yml) with:
- The term/page affected
- What's wrong
- What it should say (if you know)

## Development Setup

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/amarrmb/robotics-glossary.git
cd robotics-glossary

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
# Opens at http://localhost:4321/robotics-glossary/
```

```

## Creating a New Term

1. Create a new `.md` or `.mdx` file in the appropriate category folder
2. Use this frontmatter template:

```yaml
---
title: Term Name
description: One-line description (shown in search results)
sidebar:
  badge:
    text: Conceptual  # or Practical, Deep Dive
    variant: note     # note (blue), success (green), tip (purple)
---
```

3. Add the level badge at the top of your content:

```html
<span class="level-badge conceptual">Conceptual</span>
```

Level options:
- `conceptual` — Theory, foundations, "what is this?"
- `practical` — Hands-on, "how do I use this?"
- `deepdive` — Comprehensive, in-depth coverage

4. Follow the content structure in the [style guide](/robotics-glossary/contributing/style-guide/)

## Pull Request Guidelines

- One term per PR (easier to review)
- Include a brief description of your changes
- Ensure the site builds: `npm run build`
- Link to any sources/references you used

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful and constructive. We're all here to learn and share knowledge about robotics.

## Questions?

- [Open a discussion](https://github.com/amarrmb/robotics-glossary/discussions) on GitHub
- Tag `@maintainers` in your issue/PR if you need help
