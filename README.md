# robotics-glossary
An open, community-maintained glossary of robotics concepts, hardware, software, and ecosystems — inspired by the Modal GPU Glossary, with extended coverage of the NVIDIA robotics ecosystem.

# Why this exists?
Robotics spans many disciplines—control theory, computer vision, embedded systems, AI, and mechanical engineering.
As a result:
1) The same term can mean different things in different contexts
2) Important concepts are scattered across textbooks, wikis, and vendor docs
3) Beginners struggle to build a mental map of how concepts relate

This glossary is meant to be a navigation layer, not a replacement for textbooks, papers, or standards.

## What this project is?
- A curated glossary of robotics terms
- Focused on clarity, context, and cross-linking
- Open-source and community-editable
- Practical: includes concepts, algorithms, and commonly used tools/platforms

## What this project is not?
- Not an official standard (IEEE, ISO, NIST, etc.)
- Not a full tutorial or textbook. (Although you could use it as a starting point)
- Not a replacement for Wikipedia or academic references
- Think of it as an index and map to robotics knowledge.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome and encouraged. You can help by:
- Adding missing terms
- Improving definitions
- Fixing inaccuracies
- Adding references or links between concepts

Please see CONTRIBUTING.md for guidelines.
