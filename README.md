# Robotics Glossary
An open, community-maintained glossary of robotics concepts, hardware, software, and ecosystems — inspired by the Modal GPU Glossary, with extended coverage of the NVIDIA robotics ecosystem.

# Why this exists?
Robotics spans many disciplines—control theory, computer vision, embedded systems, AI, and mechanical engineering.
As a result:
1) The same term can mean different things in different contexts
2) Important concepts are scattered across textbooks, wikis, and vendor docs
3) Beginners struggle to build a mental map of how concepts relate

This glossary is meant to be a navigation layer, not a replacement for textbooks, papers, or standards.

## Covers

  Heavy focus on the NVIDIA robotics stack since that's what I work with most.
